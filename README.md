This tool will run through a combolist attempting to login directly to CrunchyRoll. A [combolist] file is a file with a list of logins. Be aware there will be a bunch of free accounts due to a large amount of people who create an account on CrunchyRoll but never buy a plan. Hit are logged on the terminal and in a text file in the results folder. I have provided a 260k combo list ready for you to use. 

## SETUP
```
git clone https://github.com/RetroPackets/Crunchy-Thief
cd Crunchy-Theif
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 crunchy.py
